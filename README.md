**HOW TO USE THE JUPYTER NOTEBOOK**
This notebook shall work in colab as well offline if its dependencies are installed. 
If using offline, please install the following libraries in your virtual environment:

1. faiss-cpu
2. sentence-transformers
3. numpy
4. PyMuPDF

(you can use pip install {library name} command for your installation.)

Now, we upload the file to read, note the name of the file and paste the name of the file in pdf_document variable.
